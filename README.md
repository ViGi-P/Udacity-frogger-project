Playing the game
----------------
The goal of the game is to move the player at the bottom of the board to obtain as many collectibles as possible in 30 seconds, while avoiding the enemies.

Use the arrow keys to move the player around the board.  If the player comes
into contact with an enemy, you lose two points and the player is moved back to the
start position.

Change the difficulty by selecting "easy," "medium," or "hard" from the radio
buttons on the left.  The scoreboard tells you how many points
you've collected.
