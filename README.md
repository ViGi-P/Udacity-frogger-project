Running the game

Visit the index.html file in your browser.

Playing the game
----------------
The goal of the game is to move the player at the bottom of the board to the
water at the top of the board, while avoiding the enemies.

Use the arrow keys to move the player around the board.  If the player comes
into contact with an enemy, the game is lost and the player is moved back to the
start position.

Change the difficulty by selecting "easy," "medium," or "hard" from the radio 
buttons on the left.  The scoreboard below the buttons tells you how many times 
you've won/lost since changing to that difficulty level.
